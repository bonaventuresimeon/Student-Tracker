## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB connection issues?**  
Verify your connection string and whitelist your IP on MongoDB Atlas.

- **Vault token errors?**  
Confirm your Vault token is valid and Vault server is reachable.

- **Docker container crashes?**  
Check logs with `docker logs <container_id>` and ensure environment variables are set.

Confirm endpoints and parameters are correct and the server is running.
