docker login

	•	Tag and push your image (replace your-dockerhub-username accordingly):

docker tag student-tracker your-dockerhub-username/student-tracker
docker push your-dockerhub-username/student-tracker

📬 API Endpoints

⚙️ Environment Variables

Variable	Description	Example
VAULT_TOKEN	Vault authentication token	s.1234567890abcdef
MONGO_URI	MongoDB connection URI	mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.mongodb.net/db

Make sure to place these variables in a .env file or your environment to avoid exposing sensitive data.

🛠 Troubleshooting
	•	MongoDB connection issues?
Verify your connection string and whitelist your IP on MongoDB Atlas.
	•	Vault token errors?
Confirm your Vault token is valid and Vault server is reachable.
	•	Docker container crashes?
Check logs with docker logs <container_id> and ensure environment variables are set.
